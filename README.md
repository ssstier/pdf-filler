Dashy is a GUI-based program that inputs data into fillable PDF forms.

Given a text source with a common structure, relevant data can be programatically filtered and written to a PDF template.

To see the program in action, follow these steps:

1. Open app.py
2. Click the settings tab and then set an output directory to set the path the filled PDF will be sent. 
3. Click the Dashy tab and then copy the example_input.txt into your clipboard and the paste it into the Dashy GUI.
4. Click the generate button.
 
 The logic for filtering example_input.txt is found in parser.py. Replace the logic in this file to fit your needs.
